This section documents changes made since the ``last'' release of
the software. 

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent
This is currently version 1.0 of the SCALE and MAMBA software.
There are two main components to the system, a run time system called
SCALE,
\begin{center}
  Secure Computation Algorithms from LEuven
\end{center}
and a Python-like programming language called MAMBA
\begin{center}
  Multiparty AlgorithMs Basic Argot
\end{center}
Note, that MAMBA is a type of snake (like a Python), a snake
has scales, and an argot is a ``secret language''.

\noindent
The software is a major modification of the earlier SPDZ software. 
You {\em should not} assume it works the same so please read
the documentation fully before proceeding.


\subsection{Changes From SPDZ}
Apart from the way the system is configured and run there are
a number of functionality changes which we outline below.

\subsubsection{Things no longer supported}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We do not support any $GF(2^n)$ arithmetic in the run time 
environment. The compiler will no longer compile your programs.
\item There are much fewer switches in the main program, as we want
to produce a system which is easier to support and more useful in
building applications.
\item Socket connections, file, and other forms of IO to the main MPC
engine is now unified into a single location. This allows {\em you} to
extend the functionality without altering the compiler or
run-time in any way (bar changing which IO class you load
at compile time). See Section \ref{sec:IO} for details.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Additions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The offline and online phases are now fully integrated.
This means that run-times will be slower than you would have got
with SPDZ, but the run-times obtained are closer to what you would
expect in a ``real'' system.
{\bf Both} the online and offline phases are {\bf actively} secure
with abort.
\item Due to this change it can be slow to start a new instance
and run a new program. So we provide a new (experimental) operation which 
``restarts'' the run-time. This is described in Section \ref{sec:restart}.
This operation is likely to be revamped and improved in the next
release as we get more feedback on its usage.
\item We support various Q2 access structures now, which can be
defined in various ways: Shamir threshold, via Replicated sharing,
or via a general Monotone Span Programme (MSP).
For replicated sharing you can define the structure
via either the minimally qualified sets, or the maximally unqualified
sets.
For general Q2-MSPs you can input a non-multiplicative MSP and the
system will find an equivalent multiplicative one for you using the
method of \cite{CDM00}.
\item Offline generation for Q2 is done via Maurer's method \cite{Maurer}, but
for Replicated you can choose between Maurer and the reduced communication
method of Keller, Rotaru, Smart and Wood \cite{KRSW}.
For general Q2-MSPs, and Shamir sharing, the online phase is the method described in Smart and Wood \cite{SW18},
with ({\em currently}) the offline phase utilizing Maurer's multiplication method \cite{Maurer}.
\item All player connections are now via SSL, this is not strictly
needed for full threshold but is needed for the other access structures
we now support.
\item We now have implemented more higher level mathematical functions for
the \verb+sfix+ datatype, and corrected a number of bugs. 
A similar upgrade is expected in the next release for the \verb+sfloat+ type.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Changes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\bf major} change is that the offline and online phases are now integrated.
This means that to run quick test runs, using full threshold is going to take
ages to set up the offline data. Thus for test runs of programs in the online
phase it is best to test using one of the many forms of Q2 access structures.
For example by using Shamir with three players and threshold one. Then once your
online program is tested you can move to a production system with two players
and full threshold if desired.
\item You now compile a program by executing
\begin{verbatim}
      ./compile.py Programs/tutorial
\end{verbatim}
where \verb+Programs/tutorial+ is a {\em directory} which contains
a file called \verb+tutorial.mpc+. Then the compiler puts all of the
compiled tapes etc {\em into this directory}.
This produces a much cleaner directory output etc.
By typing \verb+make pclean+ you can clean up all pre-compiled directorys
into their initial state.
\item The compiler picks up the prime being used for secret sharing
after running the second part of \verb+Setup.x+. So you need to recompile
the \verb+.mpc+ files if  you change the prime used in secret sharing, and you
should not compile any SCALE \verb+.mpc+ programs before running \verb+Setup.x+.
\item Internally (i.e. in the C++ code), a lot has been re-organized. The major simplification
is removal of the \verb+octetstream+ class, and it's replacement by a combination
of \verb+stringstream+ and \verb+string+ instead. This makes readibility
much easier.
\item All opcodes in the range \verb+0xB*+ have been changed, so any byte codes
you have generated from outside the python system will need to be changed.
\item We have tried to reduce dependencies between classes in the 
C++ code a lot more. Thus making the code easier to manage.
\item Security-wise we use the latest FHE security estimates for the
FHE-based part, and this can be easily updated. See Chapter \ref{sec:fhe} on FHE
security later.
\end{enumerate}
