\mainsection{Programmatic Restarting}
\label{sec:restart}
Because, unlike in SPDZ, the offline and online phases are totally
integrated, it can takes a long time for the queues of pre-processed
triples to be full. This means that quickly starting an instance to
run a short program can be very time-consuming. For reactive systems
in which the precise program which is going to be run is not known
until just before execution this can be a problem.
We therefore provide a mechanism, which we call \verb+RESTART+, to
enable a program to {\em programatically} restart the online runtime, whilst 
still maintaining the current offline data.
In the bytecode this is accessed by the op-code \verb+RESTART+
and in MAMBA it is accessed by the function \verb+restart(Schedule &schedule)+.
Both must be called in online thread zero.

The basic model is as follows.
You start an instance of the SCALE engine with some (possibly
dummy) program. This program instance will define the total number
of online threads you will ever need; this is because we do not
want a restart operation to have to spawn new offline threads.
You then ensure that the last operation performed by this
program is a \verb+RESTART+/\verb+restart(Schedule &schedule)+.
At this point the runtime waits for a trigger to be obtained
from {\em each} player on the IO functionality (see
Section \ref{sec:IO}).
This trigger can be anything, but in our default IO class it
is simply each player needing to enter a value on the standard
input.

The reason for this triggering is that the system which is
calling SCALE {\em may} want to replace the underlying
schedule file and tapes; thus enabling the execution of
a new program entirely.

The specific \verb+restart(Schedule &schedule)+ function in the  
IO functionality will now be executed.
In the provided variant of IO functionality, given in
\verb+Input_Output_Simple+, the schedule file is reloaded 
from the {\em same directory} as the original program instance.
This also reloads the tapes etc.

You could implement your own \verb+restart(Schedule &schedule)+ function in your
own IO functionality which programmatically alters
the underlying schedule to be executed, via the argument to \verb+restart+. 
This enables a more programmatic control of the SCALE engine.

To see this in operation we provide the following simple
examples, in \verb+Programs/restart_1/restart.mpc+
and \verb+Programs/restart_2/restart.mpc+.
To see these in operation execute the following commands
from the main directory (assuming you are using the
default IO functionality,
\begin{verbatim}
            \cp Programs/restart_1/restart.mpc Programs/restart/
            ./compile.py Programs/restart
\end{verbatim}
Now run the resulting program as normal, i.e. using \verb+Programs/restart+
as the program.
When this program has finished it asks (assuming you are
using the default IO class) for all players to enter
a number. {\em Do not do this yet!}
First get the next program ready to run by executing
\begin{verbatim}
        \cp Programs/restart_2/restart.mpc Programs/restart/
        ./compile.py Programs/restart
\end{verbatim}
Now enter a number on each players console, and 
the second program should now run.
Since it also ends with a \verb+RESTART+ bytecode, you can
continue in this way forever.
